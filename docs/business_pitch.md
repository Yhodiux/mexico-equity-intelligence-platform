# Business Pitch

## One-Line Pitch

BMV Market Intelligence Platform turns public Mexican market data into governed, monetizable data products, APIs, dashboards, alerts, and AI-ready insights.

## Business Problem

Raw market prices are widely available, but they are not directly monetizable.

For a stock exchange or financial data provider, the business opportunity is not only publishing prices. The commercial value comes from transforming trusted market activity into products that help customers monitor risk, compare issuers, detect liquidity changes, explain market behavior, and make faster decisions.

Business users need curated answers:

- Which issuers are outperforming?
- Which sectors are showing higher volatility?
- Which companies have unusual trading activity?
- Which market signals deserve attention today?
- Can an AI assistant answer these questions without inventing unsupported claims?

The gap is not access to raw data. The gap is turning data into trusted products that can be sold, reused, audited, and consumed by business teams or external customers.

## Proposed Solution

The platform builds a local end-to-end market intelligence product:

```text
Public Market Data -> Raw -> Silver -> Quality -> Gold -> Metadata -> API -> Dashboard -> AI Agent
```

The MVP uses public Yahoo Finance data for reproducibility, but the architecture is designed around the same product principles needed for BMV-style market intelligence:

- Governed data layers.
- Data quality gates.
- Reusable Gold data products.
- Metadata catalog.
- API distribution.
- Analyst dashboard.
- Deterministic AI Agent grounded in trusted datasets.

## Why This Is More Than a Dashboard

A dashboard is only one consumption channel.

This solution creates reusable data products that can support multiple commercial channels:

- APIs for external or internal consumers.
- Dashboards for analysts and executives.
- Alerts for time-sensitive market signals.
- AI Agent responses grounded in Gold datasets.
- Reports generated from curated market intelligence.
- Future integrations with licensed BMV data sources.

The dashboard shows the value, but the Gold datasets and API layer are the monetizable foundation.

## Exchange Business Fit

The platform is aligned with how exchanges and financial information businesses create value from market data:

| Business Area | Platform Fit | Commercial Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market data distribution | Gold datasets exposed through APIs | Subscription-ready intelligence products |
| Issuer relations | Issuer performance, sector comparison, liquidity, and trend views | Better conversations with listed companies |
| Broker and analyst services | Ranked performance, volatility, liquidity, and unusual activity signals | Faster research workflows and differentiated insights |
| Data vendor and fintech channels | Governed datasets with clear contracts and metadata | Reusable feeds for downstream products |
| Executive and commercial teams | Dashboard, reports, and AI-ready summaries | Market narratives that support decisions and client engagement |

This matters because a stock exchange sells trust, coverage, timeliness, governance, and interpretation. The MVP demonstrates those capabilities through reproducible data products rather than only through technical infrastructure.

## Productized Gold Datasets

### Performance Product

Ranks issuers by 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day performance.

Commercial use:

- Market summaries.
- Winner and loser rankings.
- Momentum products.
- Issuer comparison tools.

### Volatility Product

Measures rolling issuer volatility and classifies risk levels.

Commercial use:

- Risk intelligence.
- Sector volatility monitoring.
- Risk-adjusted issuer screening.
- Premium risk dashboards.

### Liquidity Product

Measures trading activity, liquidity score, and unusual volume behavior.

Commercial use:

- Liquidity ranking.
- Unusual activity alerts.
- Market participation analysis.
- Institutional research tools.

### Market Trends Product

Compares issuer movement against sector behavior.

Commercial use:

- Sector intelligence.
- Issuer divergence detection.
- Executive market narratives.
- Analyst decision support.

### AI Insights Product

Converts computed market signals into explainable business interpretations.

Commercial use:

- AI-ready insight feeds.
- Executive summaries.
- Analyst prompts.
- Controlled AI assistant responses.

## Monetization Model

The platform can support several paid product lines:

| Product Line | Buyer | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Market Intelligence API | Fintechs, analysts, internal apps | Direct access to curated datasets |
| Premium Dashboard | Analysts, executives, issuer relations | Fast monitoring and decision support |
| Alerting Service | Research, trading support, risk teams | Signals for volatility, volume, and performance changes |
| Sector Intelligence Reports | Business development, sales, research | Recurring market narratives and issuer comparisons |
| AI Market Assistant | Business users and analysts | Natural-language access to governed market intelligence |

The same data foundation can also support tiering:

- Basic tier: delayed market summaries and top rankings.
- Professional tier: API access, sector dashboards, and issuer-level comparisons.
- Enterprise tier: custom reports, alerts, entitlements, and AI assistant access.

## KPIs and OKRs

The business value can be measured through data quality, freshness, product coverage, API usage, dashboard adoption, AI guardrail behavior, and customer consumption.

The KPI and OKR framework is documented in [Business KPIs and OKRs](business_kpis_okrs.md). It connects the current MVP evidence to production metrics such as usage metering, subscription tiers, customer entitlements, SLAs, and monetization readiness.

## AI Value Proposition

The AI Agent is intentionally constrained.

It answers supported market intelligence questions using Gold datasets as the source of truth. Unsupported questions return suggested supported questions instead of invented answers.

This is important for business adoption because market intelligence needs:

- Traceability.
- Guardrails.
- Auditable answers.
- Consistent behavior.
- No unsupported predictions.

The MVP proves that AI can be added as a product interface without losing control of the data foundation.

## Why This Can Scale

The current MVP runs locally with Docker and public data so evaluators can reproduce it easily.

The same architecture can scale into a production product by adding:

- Licensed BMV data sources.
- Scheduled orchestration.
- Database or lakehouse storage.
- Authentication and API keys.
- Customer-specific entitlements.
- Paid subscription tiers.
- LLM-based narrative generation grounded in Gold datasets.
- Monitoring, SLAs, and data contracts.

## Final Business Message

This solution demonstrates the commercial path from raw market data to monetizable intelligence:

```text
Data quality -> Data products -> API distribution -> Dashboard consumption -> AI interface -> Subscription potential
```

The result is a platform that can be positioned not as a technical demo, but as the foundation for a market intelligence product line.

# Data Products

## Product Strategy

The platform treats public market data as the input for reusable data products, not as the final deliverable.

The value chain is:

```text
Raw prices -> Clean signals -> Business metrics -> API products -> AI-ready answers
```

The Gold layer is where market data becomes monetizable. Each Gold dataset is shaped around a business question that a financial analyst, market data customer, issuer relations team, or intelligence product could consume.

For a stock exchange or market data business, this is the difference between data availability and revenue. Prices and volumes become more valuable when they are governed, compared, ranked, explained, distributed through APIs, and packaged for specific customer workflows.

## Monetization Patterns

The Gold datasets can support several data product models:

- Analyst dashboards for performance, risk, liquidity, and trends.
- Daily market insight reports generated from `gold_ai_insights`.
- Premium alerting based on unusual volume, negative pressure, or high volatility.
- Sector intelligence products for issuer relations, research, or sales teams.
- Issuer intelligence packages that compare each listed company against sector and market behavior.
- Enterprise tiers with API keys, entitlements, SLAs, and customer-specific reporting.

## Revenue Logic

The platform creates business value through repeatable information products:

| Dataset | Product Logic | Revenue Opportunity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gold_performance` | Turns price history into rankings, momentum, and issuer comparison | Market summary feeds, premium dashboards, analyst subscriptions |
| `gold_volatility` | Turns returns into risk signals | Risk intelligence products, alerts, institutional dashboards |
| `gold_liquidity` | Turns volume into participation and unusual activity signals | Liquidity analytics, issuer relations packages, trading support tools |
| `gold_market_trends` | Adds sector context and relative behavior | Sector intelligence reports, issuer benchmarking, executive narratives |
| `gold_ai_insights` | Converts computed signals into explainable business language | AI assistant, automated reports, client-ready insight feeds |

## AI Grounding

The AI Agent uses Gold datasets as its only source of truth.

This design keeps the AI behavior controlled:

- Answers are traceable to named datasets.
- Responses include supporting data points.
- Unsupported questions return suggested questions.
- The system avoids external claims and unsupported predictions.

This is intentionally conservative for the MVP. A future LLM integration could improve language quality, but it should still use Gold datasets as the retrieval and grounding layer.

# Executive Summary

## Project Overview

The BMV Market Intelligence Platform is a local, Docker-based data engineering and AI MVP for Mexican market intelligence.

It transforms public historical market data into governed, reusable, AI-ready data products:

```text
Public Market Data -> Raw -> Silver -> Quality -> Gold -> Metadata -> API -> Dashboard -> AI Agent
```

The project is designed to be reproducible by an evaluator without BMV credentials, paid services, cloud accounts, or local Python setup.

## Business Problem

Public market data is useful, but raw prices alone are not a monetizable product. The platform demonstrates how public issuer data can be transformed into curated data products that support:

- Market performance monitoring
- Risk and volatility intelligence
- Liquidity and trading activity analysis
- Sector and issuer trend discovery
- AI-ready insights grounded in governed datasets

## Technical Scope

The MVP implements:

- Docker Compose orchestration
- Yahoo Finance ingestion through `yfinance`
- Raw, Silver, and Gold data layers
- Data quality validation
- Metadata catalog generation
- FastAPI data product API
- Deterministic AI Agent
- Streamlit dashboard
- Automated tests
- Architecture and demo documentation

## Data Product Layers

### Raw

Raw market prices are stored as Parquet files and preserve the source structure:

```text
date
ticker
open
high
low
close
adj_close
volume
```

### Silver

Silver standardizes and enriches Raw data with issuer metadata and derived metrics:

```text
daily_return
intraday_volatility
price_range
volume_category
trend_flag
issuer_name
sector
ingestion_timestamp
```

### Gold

Gold turns market data into reusable data products:

- `gold_performance`
- `gold_volatility`
- `gold_liquidity`
- `gold_market_trends`
- `gold_ai_insights`

These datasets support dashboards, APIs, and grounded AI answers.

## AI Strategy

The AI Agent is deterministic and domain-constrained.

It answers supported market intelligence questions using Gold datasets as the source of truth. Unsupported questions return suggested supported questions instead of invented answers.

This design demonstrates AI guardrails:

- No external claims
- No unsupported predictions
- Source datasets included in responses
- Structured data points returned with answers

## Dashboard Demo

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard starts with dataset status, KPIs, executive overview, and 30-day performance rankings.

### Analytics Sections

The analytics view includes risk, volatility, liquidity, unusual volume, and supporting tables.

### AI Agent in Dashboard

The dashboard includes AI-ready insights and an embedded Market Intelligence Agent question selector.

## API Demo

### Supported Ask Request

The `/ask` endpoint returns structured answers grounded in Gold Performance data.

### Guardrail Behavior

Unsupported questions are rejected safely with suggested supported market intelligence questions.

## How to Run

Run the full pipeline:

```bash
docker compose run --rm pipeline
```

Run tests:

```bash
docker compose run --rm tests
```

Start the dashboard:

```bash
docker compose up dashboard
```

Start the API:

```bash
docker compose up api
```

## Evaluation Highlights

- Fully local and reproducible with Docker
- No paid BMV services or credentials required
- Data quality checks built into the pipeline
- Gold datasets framed as monetizable data products
- API and dashboard consume the same governed datasets
- AI Agent is grounded, auditable, and domain-constrained
- Automated tests validate core behavior

## Recommended Review Path

1. Run the pipeline.
2. Run tests.
3. Open the dashboard.
4. Review performance, volatility, liquidity, and insights.
5. Ask a supported market intelligence question.
6. Ask an unsupported question to verify guardrails.
7. Review FastAPI `/docs`.

# Project Status - 2026-06-18

## Current Repository State

- Repository: `https://github.com/Yhodiux/mexico-equity-intelligence-platform`
- Branch: `main`
- Release candidate target: `v1.0-rc2`
- Recommended review tag: `v1.0-rc2`
- Previous stable demo tag: `v1.0-demo`
- Local workspace: `F:/Proyectos/mexico-equity-intelligence-platform`

## Current Positioning

Main message:

```text
Transforming public market data into AI-ready data products for Market Intelligence and data monetization.
```

The project is positioned as a reproducible Data Engineering, Advanced Analytics, and AI MVP for Market Intelligence services.

It is explicitly not positioned as:

- A trading system.
- A stock price prediction platform.
- An investment recommender.
- A forecasting product in the current MVP.
- A quantitative trading model.

Forecasting, anomaly detection, and personalization are documented only as future roadmap phases.

## Current MVP Scope

- Raw/Silver/Gold local data architecture.
- Data quality gate.
- Metadata catalog.
- Gold data products for performance, volatility, liquidity, market trends, and AI-ready insights.
- FastAPI endpoints over governed Gold datasets.
- Streamlit dashboard.
- Deterministic governed AI agent.
- Optional LLM-governed assistant over structured Gold evidence.
- Guardrails for out-of-domain questions, forecasting, price targets, and buy/sell recommendations.
- Docker-based reproducibility.
- Review documentation, release notes, and demo guide.

## Validated Demo Behavior

Validated locally through Docker:

- API health endpoint returns `status: ok`.
- Dashboard loads on `http://localhost:8501`.
- API docs load on `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
- Deterministic `/ask` answers governed market intelligence questions.
- `/ask-llm` returns model-backed answers when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured.
- Out-of-domain questions are blocked.
- Forecasting and investment-advice questions are blocked.
- Automated tests passed with `docker compose run --rm tests`: `23 passed`.

## Review Entry Points

- README: `README.md`
- Demo guide: `docs/demo_guide.md`
- Release notes: `docs/release_notes_v1_0_rc2.md`
- Executive summary: `docs/executive_summary.md`
- Business pitch: `docs/business_pitch.md`
- Data flow architecture: `docs/architecture/data_flow.md`
- Data products: `docs/architecture/data_products.md`
- Cloud roadmap: `docs/architecture/cloud_roadmap.md`

## Delivery Notes

- `.env.example` is committed.
- `.env` is ignored and must not be committed.
- Real OpenAI API keys must be shared outside the repository through a temporary/private channel.
- OpenAI API usage may generate costs and requires billing or credits.
- The project runs without an OpenAI API key; `/ask-llm` returns a controlled configuration response in that mode.

## Release Delivery

- Final pipeline, automated test, API, and dashboard validation completed successfully.
- `v1.0-rc2` is the recommended release candidate for external review.
- Share the repository and `v1.0-rc2` release tag with the evaluator.
- Keep all real API keys private and outside the repository.

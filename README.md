# BMV Market Intelligence Platform

Local data engineering MVP for Mexican market intelligence data products.

The platform transforms public Mexican market data into governed, reusable, AI-ready data products:

```text
Public Market Data -> Raw -> Silver -> Quality -> Gold -> Metadata -> API -> AI Agent
```

## Business Value

This project is not only a price-data pipeline. It demonstrates how market data can be packaged as a business-ready intelligence product.

The platform is framed from the point of view of a stock exchange or financial data provider: raw trades and prices are inputs, but the business sells trusted information, distribution, analytics, access, and decision support.

The platform helps a market data business, exchange, issuer relations team, or financial intelligence provider:

- Convert raw public market prices into reusable data products.
- Offer performance, volatility, liquidity, trend, and AI-ready insight datasets.
- Expose governed datasets through APIs for downstream customers and applications.
- Give analysts and business users a dashboard for fast market monitoring.
- Use an AI Agent that answers only from controlled Gold datasets, reducing hallucination risk.
- Create a foundation for premium subscriptions, executive reports, alerts, and sector intelligence products.

## Stock Exchange Business Context

A stock exchange monetizes more than transactions. It can create business value by packaging market activity into products for issuers, brokers, investors, fintechs, data vendors, research teams, and internal commercial teams.

This MVP shows how that information business can work:

- **Issuers** can understand how their stock compares with sector behavior, liquidity, and market attention.
- **Brokers and analysts** can consume ranked performance, risk, liquidity, and trend signals.
- **Fintechs and data vendors** can integrate curated market intelligence through APIs.
- **Internal exchange teams** can use dashboards and reports to support issuer relations, market development, and premium data services.
- **Executives** can receive explainable summaries instead of raw price tables.

## Monetization Strategy

The Gold layer is designed as the commercial product layer. Each dataset answers a business question that can become a paid feature:

- **API subscriptions:** endpoints for performance, volatility, liquidity, trends, and insights.
- **Premium dashboard:** analyst-facing market intelligence views for monitoring issuers and sectors.
- **Market alerts:** unusual volume, elevated volatility, underperformance, or sustained growth signals.
- **Executive reports:** recurring summaries generated from governed Gold datasets.
- **AI assistant:** a controlled question-answering interface over trusted market intelligence products.

The commercial idea is simple: the value is not the raw price history; the value is the governed layer that turns data into decisions, APIs, alerts, and explainable AI responses.

## Prerequisites

## Run pipeline

This pipeline downloads daily historical prices from Yahoo Finance, writes raw Parquet files under `data/raw/`, builds the standardized Silver dataset under `data/silver/`, writes a data quality report under `data/metadata/`, and generates Gold data products under `data/gold/`.

```bash
docker compose run --rm pipeline
```

The pipeline uses the ticker universe defined in `config/tickers.json`.

## Gold datasets

The Gold layer currently generates:

- `gold_performance.parquet`
- `gold_volatility.parquet`
- `gold_liquidity.parquet`
- `gold_market_trends.parquet`
- `gold_ai_insights.parquet`

## Run API

After running the pipeline, start the local API:

```bash
docker compose up api
```

Available endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /datasets`
- `GET /performance`
- `GET /volatility`
- `GET /liquidity`
- `GET /market-trends`
- `GET /ai-insights`
- `POST /ask`

## Run Dashboard

After running the pipeline, start the local Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
docker compose up dashboard
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

## Ask the Agent

The `/ask` endpoint answers supported market intelligence questions using the Gold datasets.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"question\":\"Which issuers had the best 30-day performance?\"}"
```

Supported questions include:

- Which issuers had the best 30-day performance?
- Which issuers show sustained growth with controlled volatility?
- Which sectors show higher volatility?
- Which companies show unusual volume behavior?
- What are the most relevant market insights?

## Run Tests

Run the automated test suite with Docker:

```bash
docker compose run --rm tests
```
